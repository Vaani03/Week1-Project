INTRODUCTION
Image Processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image.
Image Processing is among rapidly growing technologies and has many applications also. Some of its applications are:
•	Face Recognition,
•	Counting: like counting the number of people, objects, vehicles, etc...
•	Object Recognition,
•	Anomaly detection.
Image Processing basically includes the following three steps:
•	Importing the image via image acquisition tools;
•	Analysing and manipulating the image;
•	Output in which result can be altered image or report that is based on image analysis.





Technology and software used

•	MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO: It is an integrated development environment (IDE). It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. It includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion product) as well as code refactoring.

•	OpenCV: OPEN SOURCE COMPUTER VISION
	Computer vision: Extracting useful information from images, videos, texts, etc…
	Available for languages like C++, Python, JAVA etc.

•	HEADER FILES USED:
	#include<opencv2/opencv.hpp>
	#include<iostream>
	#include<string.h>

•	NAMESPACES USED:
	using namespace std;
	using namespace cv;

•	FUNCTIONS AND FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS USED:
	imread()
	empty()
	namedWindow()
	imshow()
	waitKey(0)
	destroyWindow()
	warpAffine()
	getRotationMatrix2D()
	Point2f 

•	ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS:
	imread() : This function returns the image data in the array. It reads the image from the file specified by filename.
	empty() : This function checks whether the image specified by the user exists or not.
	namedWindow() : This function creates a new window which can open the image.
	imshow()  : This function will display the image in that new window created by namedWindow() function.
	waitKey(0) : This function waits for the user to enter a key and then destroy the window. Without this function the image will be displayed only for a while and th window will be destroyed simultaneously.
	destroyWindow() : This function destroys the window we created to view the image as soon as the user press the any key.
	warpAffine() : It is the size of the output image, which should be in the form of width and height. Here width is the number of columns and height is the number of rows.
	GetRotationMatrix2D() : This function is used to rotate the matrix image in 2D form.
	Point2f : It creates a function that contains the specified x and y-coordinates.
